# project-MeetPlace_where_reunions_happend-MAY2021
This is my final project of the Data Analystics Bootcamp at Ironhack Tech School. 

"MeetPlace" is the prototype of a website that aims to find the cheapest destination to meet. The idea is that a user could input the following: 

- Flight information: Number of people, cities of origin and departure and return date 
- Hotel preferences: Minimum rating expected and maximum distance to the city center Afterwards, MeetPlace would indicate the cheapest city to meet according to both flights and hotel bookings prices. 

Enjoy!
